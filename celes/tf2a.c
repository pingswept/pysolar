**  - - - - - - - -
**   i a u T f 2 a
**  - - - - - - - -
**
**  Convert hours, minutes, seconds to radians.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     s         char    sign:  '-' = negative, otherwise positive
**     ihour     int     hours
**     imin      int     minutes
**     sec       double  seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     rad       double  angle in radians
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status:  0 = OK
**                                1 = ihour outside range 0-23
**                                2 = imin outside range 0-59
**                                3 = sec outside range 0-59.999...
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  The result is computed even if any of the range checks fail.
**
**  2)  Negative ihour, imin and/or sec produce a warning status, but
**      the absolute value is used in the conversion.
**
**  3)  If there are multiple errors, the status value reflects only the
**      first, the smallest taking precedence.
