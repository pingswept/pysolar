**
**  Extract from the bias-precession-nutation matrix the X,Y coordinates
**  of the Celestial Intermediate Pole.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     rbpn      double[3][3]  celestial-to-true matrix (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     x,y       double        Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator (and
**     CIO or equinox) of date, and therefore the Celestial Intermediate
**     Pole unit vector is the bottom row of the matrix.
**
**  2) The arguments x,y are components of the Celestial Intermediate
**     Pole unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
**
**  Reference:
**
**     "Expressions for the Celestial Intermediate Pole and Celestial
**     Ephemeris Origin consistent with the IAU 2000A precession-
**     nutation model", Astron.Astrophys. 400, 1145-1154
**     (2003)
**
**     n.b. The celestial ephemeris origin (CEO) was renamed "celestial
**          intermediate origin" (CIO) by IAU 2006 Resolution 2.
