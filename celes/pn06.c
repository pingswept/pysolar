**
**  Precession-nutation, IAU 2006 model:  a multi-purpose function,
**  supporting classical (equinox-based) use directly and CIO-based use
**  indirectly.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double          TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     dpsi,deps    double          nutation (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     epsa         double          mean obliquity (Note 3)
**     rb           double[3][3]    frame bias matrix (Note 4)
**     rp           double[3][3]    precession matrix (Note 5)
**     rbp          double[3][3]    bias-precession matrix (Note 6)
**     rn           double[3][3]    nutation matrix (Note 7)
**     rbpn         double[3][3]    GCRS-to-true matrix (Note 8)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**      convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**      JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**      among others:
**
**             date1          date2
**
**          2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**          2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**          2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**          2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**      The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**      cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**      is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**      the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**      optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**      are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2)  The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
**      they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
**      respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
**      applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
**      any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
**
**  3)  The returned mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2006
**      precession.
**
**  4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to J2000.0 mean
**      equator and equinox by applying frame bias.
**
**  5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
**      equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
**      precession.
**
**  6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
**      equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
**      the product rp x rb.
**
**  7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean equator and equinox
**      of date to true equator and equinox of date by applying the
**      nutation (luni-solar + planetary).
**
**  8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator and
**      equinox of date.  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame
**      bias, precession and nutation in that order.
**
**  9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2000B Celestial Intermediate
**      Pole are elements (3,1-3) of the matrix rbpn.
**
**  10) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
**      arguments.  The arrays are filled in the stated order.

**     iauPfw06     bias-precession F-W angles, IAU 2006
