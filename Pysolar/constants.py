"""This file is consists of numerical constants for calculating corrections,
such as the wiggling ("nutation") of the axis of the earth. It also includes
functions for building dictionaries of polynomial functions for rapid
calculation of corrections.

Most of the constants come from a 2005 paper by Reda and Andreas:

I. Reda and A. Andreas, "Solar Position Algorithm for Solar Radiation
Applications," National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL/TP-560-34302,
revised November 2005.

http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/15003974-iP3z6k/native/15003974.PDF

However, it seems that Reda and Andreas took the bulk of the constants
(L0, etc.) from Pierre Bretagnon and Gerard Francou's Variations Seculaires
des Orbites Planetaires, or VSOP87:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_variations_of_the_planetary_orbits#VSOP87
