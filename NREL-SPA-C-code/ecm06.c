**
**  ICRS equatorial to ecliptic rotation matrix, IAU 2006.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double         TT as a 2-part Julian date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     rm           double[3][3]   ICRS to ecliptic rotation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  1) The matrix is in the sense
**
**        E_ep = rm x P_ICRS,
**
**     where P_ICRS is a vector with respect to ICRS right ascension
**     and declination axes and E_ep is the same vector with respect to
**     the (inertial) ecliptic and equinox of date.
**
**  2) P_ICRS is a free vector, merely a direction, typically of unit
**     magnitude, and not bound to any particular spatial origin, such
**     as the Earth, Sun or SSB.  No assumptions are made about whether
**     it represents starlight and embodies astrometric effects such as
**     parallax or aberration.  The transformation is approximately that
**     between mean J2000.0 right ascension and declination and ecliptic
**     longitude and latitude, with only frame bias (always less than
**     25 mas) to disturb this classical picture.
**
**  Called:
**     iauObl06     mean obliquity, IAU 2006
**     iauPmat06    PB matrix, IAU 2006
**     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     iauRx        rotate around X-axis
**     iauRxr       product of two r-matrices

**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
