**  Form rotation matrix given the Fukushima-Williams angles.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     gamb     double         F-W angle gamma_bar (radians)
**     phib     double         F-W angle phi_bar (radians)
**     psi      double         F-W angle psi (radians)
**     eps      double         F-W angle epsilon (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     r        double[3][3]   rotation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) Naming the following points:
**
**           e = J2000.0 ecliptic pole,
**           p = GCRS pole,
**           E = ecliptic pole of date,
**     and   P = CIP,
**
**     the four Fukushima-Williams angles are as follows:
**
**        gamb = gamma = epE
**        phib = phi = pE
**        psi = psi = pEP
**        eps = epsilon = EP
**
**  2) The matrix representing the combined effects of frame bias,
**     precession and nutation is:
**
**        NxPxB = R_1(-eps).R_3(-psi).R_1(phib).R_3(gamb)
**
**  3) Three different matrices can be constructed, depending on the
**     supplied angles:
**
**     o  To obtain the nutation x precession x frame bias matrix,
**        generate the four precession angles, generate the nutation
**        components and add them to the psi_bar and epsilon_A angles,
**        and call the present function.
**
**     o  To obtain the precession x frame bias matrix, generate the
**        four precession angles and call the present function.
**
**     o  To obtain the frame bias matrix, generate the four precession
**        angles for date J2000.0 and call the present function.
**
**     The nutation-only and precession-only matrices can if necessary
**     be obtained by combining these three appropriately.
**
**  Called:
**     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     iauRx        rotate around X-axis

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your

**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
