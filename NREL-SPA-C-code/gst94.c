**
**  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 1982/94
**  resolutions).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
**     JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The result is compatible with the IAU 1982 and 1994 resolutions,
**     except that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of
**     convenience in that UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute
**     the equation of the equinoxes.
**
**  3) This GAST must be used only in conjunction with contemporaneous
**     IAU standards such as 1976 precession, 1980 obliquity and 1982
**     nutation.  It is not compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
**
**  Called:
**     iauGmst82    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 1982
**     iauEqeq94    equation of the equinoxes, IAU 1994
**     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
