**
**  Transformation from ecliptic coordinates (mean equinox and ecliptic
**  of date) to ICRS RA,Dec, using the IAU 2006 precession model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2 double TT as a 2-part Julian date (Note 1)
**     dl,db       double ecliptic longitude and latitude (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     dr,dd       double ICRS right ascension and declination (radians)
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) No assumptions are made about whether the coordinates represent
**     starlight and embody astrometric effects such as parallax or
**     aberration.
**
**  3) The transformation is approximately that from ecliptic longitude
**     and latitude (mean equinox and ecliptic of date) to mean J2000.0
**     right ascension and declination, with only frame bias (always
**     less than 25 mas) to disturb this classical picture.
**
**  Called:
**     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
**     iauEcm06     J2000.0 to ecliptic rotation matrix, IAU 2006
**     iauTrxp      product of transpose of r-matrix and p-vector
**     iauC2s       unit vector to spherical coordinates
**     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
**     iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi

**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from

**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
