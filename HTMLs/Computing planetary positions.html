<a name="0"><h2>0. Foreword</h2>

Below is a description of how to compute the positions for the Sun and
Moon and the major planets, as well as for comets and minor planets,
from a set of orbital elements.<br><br>

The algorithms have been simplified as much as possible while still
keeping a fairly good accuracy.  The accuracy of the computed
positions is a fraction of an arc minute for the Sun and the inner
planets, about one arc minute for the outer planets, and 1-2 arc
minutes for the Moon.  If we limit our accuracy demands to this
level, one can simplify further by e.g. ignoring the difference
between mean, true and apparent positions.<br><br>

The positions computed below are for the 'equinox of the day', which
is suitable for computing rise/set times, but not for plotting the
position on a star map drawn for a fixed epoch.  In the latter case,
correction for precession must be applied, which is most simply
performed as a rotation along the ecliptic.<br><br>

These algortihms were developed by myself back in 1979, based on a
preprint from T. van Flandern's and K. Pulkkinen's paper "Low
precision formulae for planetary positions", published in the
Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 1980.  It's basically a
simplification of these algorithms, while keeping a reasonable
accuracy.  They were first implemented on a HP-41C programmable
pocket calculator, in 1979, and ran in less than 2 KBytes of RAM!
Nowadays considerable more accurate algorithms are available of
course, as well as more powerful computers.  Nevertheless I've
retained these algorithms as what I believe is the simplest way to
compute solar/lunar positions with an accuracy of 1-2 arc minutes.<br><br>


</a><a name="1"><h2>1. Introduction</h2>

The text below describes how to compute the positions in the sky of
the Sun, Moon and the major planets out to Neptune.  The algorithm
for Pluto is taken from a fourier fit to Pluto's position as computed
by numerical integration at JPL. Positions of other celestial bodies
as well (i.e. comets and asteroids) can also be computed, if their
orbital elements are available.<br><br>

These formulae may seem complicated, but I believe this is the
simplest method to compute planetary positions with the fairly good
accuracy of about one arc minute (=1/60 degree).  Any further
simplifications will yield lower accuracy, but of course that may be
ok, depending on the application.<br><br>


</a><a name="2"><h2>2. A few words about accuracy</h2>

The accuracy requirements are modest: a final position with an error
of no more than 1-2 arc minutes (one arc minute = 1/60 degree).  This
accuracy is in one respect quite optimal: it is the highest accuracy
one can strive for, while still being able to do many
simplifications.  The simplifications made here are:<br><br>

1: Nutation and aberration are both ignored.<br>
2: Planetary aberration (i.e. light travel time) is ignored.<br>
3: The difference between Terrestial Time/Ephemeris Time (TT/ET), and
   Universal Time (UT) is ignored.<br>
4: Precession is computed in a simplified way, by a simple addition to
   the ecliptic longitude.<br>
5: Higher-order terms in the planetary orbital elements are ignored.
   This will give an additional error of up to 2 arc min in 1000 years
   from now. For the Moon, the error will be larger: 7 arc min 1000
   years from now. This error will grow as the square of the time
   from the present.<br>
6: Most planetary perturbations are ignored. Only the major perturbation
   terms for the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, are included.  If
   still lower accuracy is acceptable, these perturbations can be ignored
   as well.<br>
7: The largest Uranus-Neptune perturbation is accounted for in the
   orbital elements of these planets.  Therefore, the orbital elements
   of Uranus and Neptune are less accurace, especially in the distant
   past and future.  The elements for these planets should therefore
   only be used for at most a few centuries into the past and the future.<br><br>


</a><a name="3"><h2>3. The time scale</h2>

The time scale in these formulae are counted in days.  Hours,
minutes, seconds are expressed as fractions of a day.  Day 0.0 occurs
at 2000 Jan 0.0 UT (or 1999 Dec 31, 0:00 UT).  This "day number" d is
computed as follows (y=year, m=month, D=date, UT=UT in
hours+decimals):<br>

<pre>    d = 367*y - 7 * ( y + (m+9)/12 ) / 4 + 275*m/9 + D - 730530
</pre>

Note that ALL divisions here should be INTEGER divisions.  In Pascal,
use "div" instead of "/", in MS-Basic, use "\" instead of "/".  In
Fortran, C and C++ "/" can be used if both y and m are integers.
Finally, include the time of the day, by adding:<br>

<pre>    d = d + UT/24.0        <i>(this is a floating-point division)</i>
</pre>


</a><a name="4"><h2>4. The orbital elements</h2>

The primary orbital elements are here denoted as:<br>

<pre>    N = longitude of the ascending node
    i = inclination to the ecliptic (plane of the Earth's orbit)
    w = argument of perihelion
    a = semi-major axis, or mean distance from Sun
    e = eccentricity (0=circle, 0-1=ellipse, 1=parabola)
    M = mean anomaly (0 at perihelion; increases uniformly with time)
</pre>

Related orbital elements are:

<pre>    w1 = N + w   = longitude of perihelion
    L  = M + w1  = mean longitude
    q  = a*(1-e) = perihelion distance
    Q  = a*(1+e) = aphelion distance
    P  = a ^ 1.5 = orbital period (years if a is in AU, astronomical units)
    T  = Epoch_of_M - (M<i>(deg)</i>/360_deg) / P  = time of perihelion
    v  = true anomaly (angle between position and perihelion)
    E  = eccentric anomaly
</pre>

One <i>Astronomical Unit (AU)</i> is the Earth's mean distance to the
Sun, or 149.6 million km.  When closest to the Sun, a planet is in
<i>perihelion</i>, and when most distant from the Sun it's in
<i>aphelion</i>.  For the Moon, an artificial satellite, or any other
body orbiting the Earth, one says <i>perigee</i> and <i>apogee</i>
instead, for the points in orbit least and most distant from Earth.<br><br>

To describe the position in the orbit, we use three angles: Mean
Anomaly, True Anomaly, and Eccentric Anomaly.  They are all zero when the
planet is in perihelion:<br>

<i>Mean Anomaly (M)</i>: This angle increases uniformly over time, by
360 degrees per orbital period.  It's zero at perihelion.  It's
easily computed from the orbital period and the time since last
perihelion.<br>

<i>True Anomaly (v)</i>: This is the actual angle between the planet
and the perihelion, as seen from the central body (in this case the
Sun).  It increases non-uniformly with time, changing most rapidly at
perihelion.<br>

<i>Eccentric Anomaly (E)</i>: This is an auxiliary angle used in
Kepler's Equation, when computing the True Anomaly from the Mean
Anomaly and the orbital eccentricity.<br>

Note that for a circular orbit (eccentricity=0), these three angles
are all equal to each other.<br><br>

Another quantity we will need is ecl, the <i>obliquity of the
ecliptic</i>, i.e.  the "tilt" of the Earth's axis of rotation
(currently 23.4 degrees and slowly decreasing). First, compute the
"d" of the moment of interest (</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#3">section 3</a>). Then,
compute the obliquity of the ecliptic:<br>

<pre>    ecl = 23.4393 - 3.563E-7 * d
</pre>

Now compute the orbital elements of the planet of interest.  If you
want the position of the Sun or the Moon, you only need to compute
the orbital elements for the Sun or the Moon. If you want the
position of any other planet, you must compute the orbital elements
for that planet <i>and</i> for the Sun (of course the orbital
elements for the Sun are really the orbital elements for the Earth;
however it's customary to here pretend that the Sun orbits the
Earth). This is necessary to be able to compute the geocentric
position of the planet.<br><br>

Please note that a, the semi-major axis, is given in Earth radii for
the Moon, but in Astronomical Units for the Sun and all the planets.<br><br>

When computing M (and, for the Moon, when computing N and w as well),
one will quite often get a result that is larger than 360 degrees, or
negative (all angles are here computed in degrees).  If negative,
add 360 degrees until positive.  If larger than 360 degrees, subtract
360 degrees until the value is less than 360 degrees.  Note that, in
most programming languages, one must then multiply these angles with
pi/180 to convert them to radians, before taking the sine or cosine
of them.<br><br>

</pre>

Please note than the orbital elements of Uranus and Neptune as given
here are somewhat less accurate. They include a long period
perturbation between Uranus and Neptune. The period of the
perturbation is about 4200 years. Therefore, these elements should
not be expected to give results within the stated accuracy for more
than a few centuries in the past and into the future.<br><br>


</a><a name="5"><h2>5. The position of the Sun</h2>

The position of the Sun is computed just like the position of any
other planet, but since the Sun always is moving in the ecliptic, and
since the eccentricity of the orbit is quite small, a few
simplifications can be made. Therefore, a separate presentation for
the Sun is given.<br><br>

Of course, we're here really computing the position of the Earth in
its orbit around the Sun, but since we're viewing the sky from an
Earth-centered perspective, we'll pretend that the Sun is in orbit
around the Earth instead.<br><br>

First, compute the eccentric anomaly E from the mean anomaly M
and from the eccentricity e (E and M in degrees):<br>

<pre>    E = M + e*(180/pi) * sin(M) * ( 1.0 + e * cos(M) )
</pre>

or (if E and M are expressed in radians):<br>

<pre>    E = M + e * sin(M) * ( 1.0 + e * cos(M) )
</pre>

Note that the formulae for computing E are not exact; however they're
accurate enough here.<br><br>

</a><a name="5a">
Then compute the Sun's distance r and its true anomaly v from:<br>

<pre>    xv = r * cos(v) = cos(E) - e
    yv = r * sin(v) = sqrt(1.0 - e*e) * sin(E)

    v = atan2( yv, xv )
    r = sqrt( xv*xv + yv*yv )
</pre>

(note that the r computed here is later used as </a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#11a">rs</a>)<br><br>

atan2() is a function that converts an x,y coordinate pair to the
correct angle in all four quadrants. It is available as a library
function in Fortran, C and C++. In other languages, one has to write
one's own atan2() function.  It's not that difficult:<br>

<pre>    atan2( y, x ) = atan(y/x)                 <i>if x positive</i>
    atan2( y, x ) = atan(y/x) +- 180 degrees  <i>if x negative</i>
    atan2( y, x ) = sign(y) * 90 degrees      <i>if x zero</i>
</pre>

See these links for some code in <a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html#Bcode">Basic</a> or
<a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html#Pcode">Pascal</a>.  Fortran and C/C++ already has
atan2() as a standard library function. <br><br>

Now, compute the Sun's true longitude:<br>

<pre>    lonsun = v + w
</pre>

Convert lonsun,r to ecliptic rectangular geocentric coordinates
xs,ys:<br>

<pre>    xs = r * cos(lonsun)
    ys = r * sin(lonsun)
</pre>

(since the Sun always is in the ecliptic plane, zs is of course zero).
xs,ys is the Sun's position in a coordinate system in the plane of
the ecliptic.  To convert this to equatorial, rectangular, geocentric
coordinates, compute:<br>

<pre>    xe = xs
    ye = ys * cos(ecl)
    ze = ys * sin(ecl)
</pre>

Finally, compute the Sun's Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec):<br>

<pre>    RA  = atan2( ye, xe )
    Dec = atan2( ze, sqrt(xe*xe+ye*ye) )
</pre>
<br>

<a name="5b"> <h2>5b. The Sidereal Time</h2> 

Quite often we need a quantity called Sidereal Time.  The Local
Sideral Time (LST) is simply the RA of your local meridian.  The
Greenwich Mean Sideral Time (GMST) is the LST at Greenwich.  And,
finally, the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time at 0h UT (GMST0) is,
as the name says, the GMST at Greenwich Midnight.  However, we will
here extend the concept of GMST0 a bit, by letting "our" GMST0 be
the same as the conventional GMST0 at UT midnight but also let GMST0
be defined at any other time such that GMST0 will increase by 3m51s
every 24 hours. Then this formula will be valid at any time:<br>

<pre>    GMST = GMST0 + UT
</pre>

We also need the Sun's mean longitude, Ls, which can be computed from
the Sun's v and w as follows:

<pre>    Ls = v + w
</pre>

The GMST0 is easily computed from Ls (divide by 15 if you want GMST0
in hours rather than degrees), GMST is then computed by adding the UT,
and finally the LST is computed by adding your local longitude (east
longitude is positive, west negative).<br><br>

Note that "time" is given in hours while "angle" is given in degrees.
The two are related to one another due to the Earth's rotation: one
hour is here the same as 15 degrees.  Before adding or subtracting a
"time" and an "angle", be sure to convert them to the same unit, e.g.
degrees by multiplying the hours by 15 before adding/subtracting:<br>

<pre>    GMST0 = Ls + 180_degrees
    GMST = GMST0 + UT
    LST  = GMST + local_longitude
</pre>

The formulae above are written as if times are expressed in degrees.
If we instead assume times are given in hours and angles in degrees,
and if we explicitly write out the conversion factor of 15, we get:

<pre>    GMST0 = (Ls + 180_degrees)/15 = Ls/15 + 12_hours
    GMST = GMST0 + UT
    LST  = GMST + local_longitude/15
</pre>
<br>


</a><a name="6"><h2>6. The position of the Moon and of the planets</h2>

First, compute the eccentric anomaly, E, from M, the mean anomaly,
and e, the eccentricity.  As a first approximation, do (E and M in
degrees):<br>

<pre>    E = M + e*(180/pi) * sin(M) * ( 1.0 + e * cos(M) )
</pre>

or, if E and M are in radians:<br>

<pre>    E = M + e * sin(M) * ( 1.0 + e * cos(M) )
</pre>

If e, the eccentricity, is less than about 0.05-0.06, this
approximation is sufficiently accurate. If the eccentricity is
larger, set E0=E and then use this iteration formula (E and M in
degrees):<br>

<pre>    E1 = E0 - ( E0 - e*(180/pi) * sin(E0) - M ) / ( 1 - e * cos(E0) )
</pre>

or (E and M in radians):<br>

<pre>    E1 = E0 - ( E0 - e * sin(E0) - M ) / ( 1 - e * cos(E0) )
</pre>

For each new iteration, replace E0 with E1.  Iterate until E0 and E1
are sufficiently close together (about 0.001 degrees). For comet
orbits with eccentricites close to one, a difference of less than
1E-4 or 1E-5 degrees should be required.<br><br>

If this iteration formula won't converge, the eccentricity is
probably too close to one.  Then you should instead use the formulae
for </a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#19">near-parabolic</a> or <a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#18">parabolic</a>
orbits.<br><br>

Now compute the planet's distance and true anomaly:<br>

<pre>    xv = r * cos(v) = a * ( cos(E) - e )
    yv = r * sin(v) = a * ( sqrt(1.0 - e*e) * sin(E) )

    v = atan2( yv, xv )
    r = sqrt( xv*xv + yv*yv )
</pre>


<a name="7"><h2>7. The position in space</h2>

Compute the planet's position in 3-dimensional space:<br>

<pre>    xh = r * ( cos(N) * cos(v+w) - sin(N) * sin(v+w) * cos(i) )
    yh = r * ( sin(N) * cos(v+w) + cos(N) * sin(v+w) * cos(i) )
    zh = r * ( sin(v+w) * sin(i) )
</pre>

For the Moon, this is the geocentric (Earth-centered) position in the
ecliptic coordinate system.  For the planets, this is the
heliocentric (Sun-centered) position, also in the ecliptic coordinate
system.  If one wishes, one can compute the ecliptic longitude and
latitude (this must be done if one wishes to correct for
perturbations, or if one wants to precess the position to a standard
epoch):<br>

<pre>    lonecl = atan2( yh, xh )
    latecl = atan2( zh, sqrt(xh*xh+yh*yh) )
</pre>

As a check one can compute sqrt(xh*xh+yh*yh+zh*zh), which of course
should equal r (except for small round-off errors).<br><br>


</a><a name="8"><h2>8. Precession</h2>

If one wishes to compute the planet's position for some standard
epoch, such as 1950.0 or 2000.0 (e.g. to be able to plot the position
on a star atlas), one must add the correction below to lonecl. If a
planet's and not the Moon's position is computed, one must also add
the same correction to lonsun, the Sun's longitude.  The desired
Epoch is expressed as the year, possibly with a fraction.<br>

<pre>    lon_corr = 3.82394E-5 * ( 365.2422 * ( Epoch - 2000.0 ) - d )
</pre>

If one wishes the position for today's epoch (useful when computing
rising/setting times and the like), no corrections need to be done.<br><br>


</a><a name="9"><h2>9. Perturbations of the Moon</h2>

If the position of the Moon is computed, and one wishes a better
accuracy than about 2 degrees, the most important perturbations has
to be taken into account.  If one wishes 2 arc minute accuracy, all
the following terms should be accounted for.  If less accuracy is
needed, some of the smaller terms can be omitted.<br><br>

First compute:<br>

<pre>    Ms, Mm             <i>Mean Anomaly of the Sun and the Moon</i>
    Nm                 <i>Longitude of the Moon's node</i>
    ws, wm             <i>Argument of perihelion for the Sun and the Moon</i>
    Ls = Ms + ws       <i>Mean Longitude of the Sun  (Ns=0)</i>
    Lm = Mm + wm + Nm  <i>Mean longitude of the Moon</i>
    D = Lm - Ls        <i>Mean elongation of the Moon</i>
    F = Lm - Nm        <i>Argument of latitude for the Moon</i>
</pre>

      Add these terms to the Moon's longitude (degrees):<br>

<pre>    -1.274 * sin(Mm - 2*D)          <i>(the Evection)</i>
    +0.658 * sin(2*D)               <i>(the Variation)</i>
    -0.186 * sin(Ms)                <i>(the Yearly Equation)</i>
    -0.059 * sin(2*Mm - 2*D)
    -0.057 * sin(Mm - 2*D + Ms)
    +0.053 * sin(Mm + 2*D)
    +0.046 * sin(2*D - Ms)
    +0.041 * sin(Mm - Ms)
    -0.035 * sin(D)                 <i>(the Parallactic Equation)</i>
    -0.031 * sin(Mm + Ms)
    -0.015 * sin(2*F - 2*D)
    +0.011 * sin(Mm - 4*D)
</pre>

      Add these terms to the Moon's latitude (degrees):<br>

<pre>    -0.173 * sin(F - 2*D)
    -0.055 * sin(Mm - F - 2*D)
    -0.046 * sin(Mm + F - 2*D)
    +0.033 * sin(F + 2*D)
    +0.017 * sin(2*Mm + F)
</pre>

      Add these terms to the Moon's distance (Earth radii):<br>

<pre>    -0.58 * cos(Mm - 2*D)
    -0.46 * cos(2*D)
</pre>

All perturbation terms that are smaller than 0.01 degrees in
longitude or latitude and smaller than 0.1 Earth radii in distance
have been omitted here.  A few of the largest perturbation terms even
have their own names!  The Evection (the largest perturbation) was
discovered already by Ptolemy a few thousand years ago (the Evection
was one of Ptolemy's epicycles). The Variation and the Yearly
Equation were both discovered by Tycho Brahe in the 16'th
century.<br><br>

The computations can be simplified by omitting the smaller
perturbation terms. The error introduced by this seldom exceeds the
sum of the amplitudes of the 4-5 largest omitted terms. If one only
computes the three largest perturbation terms in longitude and the
largest term in latitude, the error in longitude will rarley exceed
0.25 degrees, and in latitude 0.15 degrees.<br><br>


</a><a name="10"><h2>10. Perturbations of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus</h2>

The only planets having perturbations larger than 0.01 degrees are
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.  First compute:<br>

<pre>    Mj    <i>Mean anomaly of Jupiter</i>
    Ms    <i>Mean anomaly of Saturn</i>
    Mu    <i>Mean anomaly of Uranus (needed for Uranus only)</i>
</pre>

      Perturbations for Jupiter.  Add these terms to the longitude:<br>

<pre>    -0.332 * sin(2*Mj - 5*Ms - 67.6 <i>degrees</i>)
    -0.056 * sin(2*Mj - 2*Ms + 21 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.042 * sin(3*Mj - 5*Ms + 21 <i>degrees</i>)
    -0.036 * sin(Mj - 2*Ms)
    +0.022 * cos(Mj - Ms)
    +0.023 * sin(2*Mj - 3*Ms + 52 <i>degrees</i>)
    -0.016 * sin(Mj - 5*Ms - 69 <i>degrees</i>)
</pre>

      Perturbations for Saturn.  Add these terms to the longitude:<br>

<pre>    +0.812 * sin(2*Mj - 5*Ms - 67.6 <i>degrees</i>)
    -0.229 * cos(2*Mj - 4*Ms - 2 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.119 * sin(Mj - 2*Ms - 3 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.046 * sin(2*Mj - 6*Ms - 69 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.014 * sin(Mj - 3*Ms + 32 <i>degrees</i>)
</pre>

      For Saturn:  <i>also</i> add these terms to the latitude:<br>

<pre>    -0.020 * cos(2*Mj - 4*Ms - 2 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.018 * sin(2*Mj - 6*Ms - 49 <i>degrees</i>)
</pre>

      Perturbations for Uranus: Add these terms to the longitude:<br>

<pre>    +0.040 * sin(Ms - 2*Mu + 6 <i>degrees</i>)
    +0.035 * sin(Ms - 3*Mu + 33 <i>degrees</i>)
    -0.015 * sin(Mj - Mu + 20 <i>degrees</i>)
</pre>

The "great Jupiter-Saturn term" is the largest perturbation for both
Jupiter and Saturn. Its period is 918 years, and its amplitude is
0.332 degrees for Jupiter and 0.812 degrees for Saturn.  These is
also a "great Saturn-Uranus term", period 560 years, amplitude 0.035
degrees for Uranus, less than 0.01 degrees for Saturn (and therefore
omitted). The other perturbations have periods between 14 and 100
years.  One should also mention the "great Uranus-Neptune term",
which has a period of 4220 years and an amplitude of about one
degree.  It is not included here, instead it is included in the
orbital elements of Uranus and Neptune.<br><br>

For Mercury, Venus and Mars we can ignore all perturbations.  For
Neptune the only significant perturbation is already included in the
orbital elements, as mentioned above, and therefore no further
perturbation terms need to be accounted for.<br><br>


</a><a name="11"><h2>11. Geocentric (Earth-centered) coordinates</h2>

Now we have computed the heliocentric (Sun-centered) coordinate of
the planet, and we have included the most important perturbations.
We want to compute the geocentric (Earth-centerd) position.  We
should convert the perturbed lonecl, latecl, r to (perturbed) xh, yh,
zh:<br>

<pre>    xh = r * cos(lonecl) * cos(latecl)
    yh = r * sin(lonecl) * cos(latecl)
    zh = r               * sin(latecl)
</pre>

If we are computing the Moon's position, this is already the geocentric
position, and thus we simply set xg=xh, yg=yh, zg=zh.  Otherwise we
must also compute the Sun's position: convert lonsun, rs (where rs is
the r computed </a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#5a">here</a>) to xs, ys:<br>

<a name="11a">
<pre>    xs = rs * cos(lonsun)
    ys = rs * sin(lonsun)
</pre>

(Of course, any correction for precession should be added to lonecl
<i>and</i> lonsun <i>before</i> converting to xh,yh,zh and xs,ys).<br><br>

Now convert from heliocentric to geocentric position:<br>

<pre>    xg = xh + xs
    yg = yh + ys
    zg = zh
</pre>

We now have the planet's geocentric (Earth centered) position in
rectangular, ecliptic coordinates.<br><br>


</a><a name="12"><h2>12. Equatorial coordinates</h2>

Let's convert our rectangular, ecliptic coordinates to rectangular,
equatorial coordinates: simply rotate the y-z-plane by ecl, the angle
of the obliquity of the ecliptic:<br>

<pre>    xe = xg
    ye = yg * cos(ecl) - zg * sin(ecl)
    ze = yg * sin(ecl) + zg * cos(ecl)
</pre>

Finally, compute the planet's Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec):<br>

<pre>    RA  = atan2( ye, xe )
    Dec = atan2( ze, sqrt(xe*xe+ye*ye) )
</pre>

Compute the geocentric distance:<br>

<pre>    rg = sqrt(xg*xg+yg*yg+zg*zg) = sqrt(xe*xe+ye*ye+ze*ze)
</pre>

Thie completes our computation of the equatorial coordinates.<br><br>

</a><a name="12b"><h2>12b. Azimuthal coordinates</h2>

To find the azimuthal coordinates (azimuth and altitude) we proceed
by computing the HA (Hour Angle) of the object.  But first we must
compute the LST (Local Sidereal Time), which we do as described in
</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#5b">5b</a> above.  When we know LST, we can easily compute
HA from:<br>

<pre>    HA = LST - RA
</pre>

HA is usually given in the interval -12 to +12 hours, or -180 to +180
degrees. If HA is zero, the object can be seen directly to the south.
If HA is negative, the object is to the east of south, and if HA is
positive, the object is to the west of south.  IF your computed HA
should fall outside this interval, add or subtract 24 hours (or 360
degrees) until HA falls within this interval.<br><br>

Now it's time to convert our objects HA and Decl to local azimuth and
altitude.  To do that, we also must know lat, our local latitude. Then
we proceed as follows:

<pre>    x = cos(HA) * cos(Decl)
    y = sin(HA) * cos(Decl)
    z = sin(Decl)

    xhor = x * sin(lat) - z * cos(lat)
    yhor = y
    zhor = x * cos(lat) + z * sin(lat)

    az  = atan2( yhor, xhor ) + 180_degrees
    alt = asin( zhor ) = atan2( zhor, sqrt(xhor*xhor+yhor*yhor) )
</pre>

This completes our calculation of the local azimuth and altitude.
Note that azimuth is 0 at North, 90 deg at East, 180 deg at South
and 270 deg at West. Altitude is of course 0 at the (mathematical)
horizon, 90 deg at zenith, and negative below the horizon.<br><br>


<a name="13"><h2>13. The Moon's topocentric position</h2>

The Moon's position, as computed earlier, is geocentric, i.e. as seen
by an imaginary observer at the center of the Earth.  Real observers
dwell on the surface of the Earth, though, and they will see a
different position - the topocentric position.  This position can
differ by more than one degree from the geocentric position.  To
compute the topocentric positions, we must add a correction to the
geocentric position.<br><br>

Let's start by computing the Moon's parallax, i.e. the apparent
size of the (equatorial) radius of the Earth, as seen from the Moon:<br>

<pre>    mpar = asin( 1/r )
</pre>

where r is the Moon's distance in Earth radii.  It's simplest to apply
the correction in horizontal coordinates (azimuth and altitude):
within our accuracy aim of 1-2 arc minutes, no correction need to be
applied to the azimuth.  One need only apply a correction to the
altitude above the horizon:<br>

<pre>    alt_topoc = alt_geoc - mpar * cos(alt_geoc)
</pre>

Sometimes one need to correct for topocentric position directly in
equatorial coordinates though, e.g. if one wants to draw on a star
map how the Moon passes in front of the Pleiades, as seen from some
specific location.  Then we need to know the Moon's geocentric
Right Ascension and Declination (RA, Decl), the Local Sidereal
Time (LST), and our latitude (lat).<br><br>

Our astronomical latitude (lat) must first be converted to a
geocentric latitude (gclat), and distance from the center of the Earth
(rho) in Earth equatorial radii.  If we only want an approximate
topocentric position, it's simplest to pretend that the Earth is
a perfect sphere, and simply set:<br>

<pre>    gclat = lat,  rho = 1.0
</pre>

However, if we do wish to account for the flattening of the Earth,
we instead compute:<br>

<pre>    gclat = lat - 0.1924_deg * sin(2*lat)
    rho   = 0.99833 + 0.00167 * cos(2*lat)
</pre>

Next we compute the Moon's geocentric Hour Angle (HA) from the Moon's
geocentric RA. First we must compute LST as described in
</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#5b">5b</a> above, then we compute HA as:<br>

<pre>    HA = LST - RA
</pre>

We also need an auxiliary angle, g:<br>

<pre>    g = atan( tan(gclat) / cos(HA) )
</pre>

Now we're ready to convert the geocentric Right Ascension and
Declination (RA, Decl) to their topocentric values (topRA, topDecl):<br>

<pre>    topRA   = RA  - mpar * rho * cos(gclat) * sin(HA) / cos(Decl)
    topDecl = Decl - mpar * rho * sin(gclat) * sin(g - Decl) / sin(g)
</pre>

<i>(Note that if decl is exactly 90 deg, cos(Decl) becomes zero and we
get a division by zero when computing topRA, but that formula breaks
down only very close to the celestial poles anyway and we never see
the Moon there.  Also if gclat is precisely zero, g becomes zero too,
and we get a division by zero when computing topDecl. In that case,
replace the formula for topDecl with
<pre>    topDecl = Decl - mpar * rho * sin(-Decl) * cos(HA)
</pre>
which is valid for gclat equal to zero; it can also be used for gclat
extremely close to zero).</i><br><br>

This correction to topocentric position can also be applied to the
Sun and the planets.  But since they're much farther away, the
correction becomes much smaller.  It's largest for Venus at inferior
conjunction, when Venus' parallax is somewhat larger than 32 arc
seconds.  Within our aim of obtaining a final accuracy of 1-2 arc
minutes, it might barely be justified to correct to topocentric
position when Venus is close to inferior conjunction, and perhaps
also when Mars is at a favourable opposition.  But in all other cases
this correction can safely be ignored within our accuracy aim.  We
only need to worry about the Moon in this case.<br><br>

If you want to compute topocentric coordinates for the planets too,
you do it the same way as for the Moon, with one exception:  the
Moon's parallax is replaced by the parallax of the planet (ppar),
as computed from this formula:<br>

<pre>    ppar = (8.794/3600)_deg / r
</pre>

where r is the distance of the planet from the Earth, in astronomical
units.<br><br>


<a name="14"><h2>14. The position of Pluto</h2>

No analytical theory has ever been constructed for the planet Pluto.
Our most accurate representation of the motion of this planet is from
numerical integrations.  Yet, a "curve fit" may be performed to these
numerical integrations, and the result will be the formulae below,
valid from about 1800 to about 2100.

Compute d, our day number, as usual (</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#3">section 3</a>).  Then
compute these angles:<br>

<pre>    S  =   50.03  +  0.033459652 * d
    P  =  238.95  +  0.003968789 * d
</pre>

Next compute the heliocentric ecliptic longitude and latitude (degrees),
and distance (a.u.):<br>

<pre>    lonecl = 238.9508  +  0.00400703 * d
            - 19.799 * sin(P)     + 19.848 * cos(P)
             + 0.897 * sin(2*P)    - 4.956 * cos(2*P)
             + 0.610 * sin(3*P)    + 1.211 * cos(3*P)
             - 0.341 * sin(4*P)    - 0.190 * cos(4*P)
             + 0.128 * sin(5*P)    - 0.034 * cos(5*P)
             - 0.038 * sin(6*P)    + 0.031 * cos(6*P)
             + 0.020 * sin(S-P)    - 0.010 * cos(S-P)

    latecl =  -3.9082
             - 5.453 * sin(P)     - 14.975 * cos(P)
             + 3.527 * sin(2*P)    + 1.673 * cos(2*P)
             - 1.051 * sin(3*P)    + 0.328 * cos(3*P)
             + 0.179 * sin(4*P)    - 0.292 * cos(4*P)
             + 0.019 * sin(5*P)    + 0.100 * cos(5*P)
             - 0.031 * sin(6*P)    - 0.026 * cos(6*P)
                                   + 0.011 * cos(S-P)

   r     =  40.72
           + 6.68 * sin(P)       + 6.90 * cos(P)
           - 1.18 * sin(2*P)     - 0.03 * cos(2*P)
           + 0.15 * sin(3*P)     - 0.14 * cos(3*P)
</pre>

Now we know the heliocentric distance and ecliptic longitude/latitude
for Pluto.  To convert to geocentric coordinates, do as for the other
planets.<br><br>



<a name="15"><h2>15. The elongation and physical ephemerides of the planets</h2>

When we finally have completed our computation of the heliocentric
and geocentric coordinates of the planets, it could also be
interesting to know what the planet will look like.  How large will
it appear?  What's its phase and magnitude (brightness)?  These
computations are much simpler than the computations of the
positions.<br><br>

Let's start by computing the apparent diameter of the planet:<br>

<pre>    d = d0 / R
</pre>

R is the planet's geocentric distance in astronomical units, and
d is the planet's apparent diameter at a distance of 1 astronomical
unit.  d0 is of course different for each planet.  The values
below are given in seconds of arc.  Some planets have different
equatorial and polar diameters:<br>

<pre>    Mercury     6.74"
    Venus      16.92"
    Earth      17.59" equ    17.53" pol
    Mars        9.36" equ     9.28" pol
    Jupiter   196.94" equ   185.08" pol
    Saturn    165.6"  equ   150.8"  pol
    Uranus     65.8"  equ    62.1"  pol
    Neptune    62.2"  equ    60.9"  pol
</pre>

The Sun's apparent diameter at 1 astronomical unit is 1919.26".  The
Moon's apparent diameter is:<br>

<pre>    d = 1873.7" * 60 / r
</pre>

where r is the Moon's distance in Earth radii.<br><br>

Two other quantities we'd like to know are the phase angle and the
elongation.<br><br>

The phase angle tells us the phase: if it's zero the planet appears
"full", if it's 90 degrees it appears "half", and if it's 180 degrees
it appears "new".  Only the Moon and the inferior planets (i.e.
Mercury and Venus) can have phase angles exceeding about 50 degrees.<br><br>

The elongation is the apparent angular distance of the planet from
the Sun.  If the elongation is smaller than about 20 degrees, the planet
is hard to observe, and if it's smaller than about 10 degrees it's
usually not possible to observe the planet.<br><br>

To compute phase angle and elongation we need to know the planet's
heliocentric distance, r, its geocentric distance, R, and the
distance to the Sun, s.  Now we can compute the phase angle, FV,
and the elongation, elong:<br>

<pre>    elong = acos( ( s*s + R*R - r*r ) / (2*s*R) )

    FV    = acos( ( r*r + R*R - s*s ) / (2*r*R) )
</pre>

When we know the phase angle, we can easily compute the phase:<br>

<pre>    phase  =  ( 1 + cos(FV) ) / 2  =  hav(180_deg - FV)
</pre>

hav is the "haversine" function.  The "haversine" (or "half versine")
is an old and now obsolete trigonometric function. It's defined as:<br>

<pre>   hav(x)  =  ( 1 - cos(x) ) / 2   =   sin^2 (x/2)
</pre>

As usual we must use a different procedure for the Moon.  Since the
Moon is so close to the Earth, the procedure above would introduce
too big errors.  Instead we use the Moon's ecliptic longitude and
latitude, mlon and mlat, and the Sun's ecliptic longitude, mlon, to
compute first the elongation, then the phase angle, of the Moon:<br>

<pre>    elong = acos( cos(slon - mlon) * cos(mlat) )
    
    FV = 180_deg - elong
</pre>

Finally we'll compute the magnitude (or brightness) of the planets.
Here we need to use a formula that's different for each planet.  FV
is the phase angle (in degrees), r is the heliocentric and R the
geocentric distance (both in AU):<br>

<pre>    Mercury:   -0.36 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.027 * FV + 2.2E-13 * FV**6
    Venus:     -4.34 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.013 * FV + 4.2E-7  * FV**3
    Mars:      -1.51 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.016 * FV
    Jupiter:   -9.25 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.014 * FV
    Saturn:    -9.0  + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.044 * FV + ring_magn
    Uranus:    -7.15 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.001 * FV
    Neptune:   -6.90 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.001 * FV

    Moon:      +0.23 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.026 * FV + 4.0E-9 * FV**4
</pre>

** is the power operator, thus FV**6 is the phase angle (in degrees)
raised to the sixth power.  If FV is 150 degrees then FV**6 becomes
ca 1.14E+13, which is a quite large number.<br><br>

For the Moon, we also need the heliocentric distance, r, and
geocentric distance, R, in AU (astronomical units).  Here r can be set
equal to the Sun's geocentric distance in AU.  The Moon's geocentric
distance, R, previously computed i Earth radii, must be converted
to AU's - we do this by multiplying by sin(17.59"/2) = 1/23450.  Or
we could modify the magnitude formula for the Moon so it uses
r in AU's and R in Earth radii:<br>

<pre>    Moon:     -21.62 + 5*log10(r*R) + 0.026 * FV + 4.0E-9 * FV**4
</pre>

Saturn needs special treatment due to its rings: when Saturn's
rings are "open" then Saturn will appear much brighter than when
we view Saturn's rings edgewise.  We'll compute ring_mang like
this:<br>

<pre>    ring_magn = -2.6 * sin(abs(B)) + 1.2 * (sin(B))**2
</pre>

Here B is the tilt of Saturn's rings which we also need to compute.
Then we start with Saturn's geocentric ecliptic longitude and
latitude (los, las) which we've already computed.  We also need the
tilt of the rings to the ecliptic, ir, and the "ascending node" of
the plane of the rings, Nr:<br>

<pre>    ir = 28.06_deg
    Nr = 169.51_deg + 3.82E-5_deg * d
</pre>

Here d is our "day number" which we've used so many times before.
Now let's compute the tilt of the rings:<br>

<pre>    B = asin( sin(las) * cos(ir) - cos(las) * sin(ir) * sin(los-Nr) )
</pre>

This concludes our computation of the magnitudes of the planets.<br><br>


</a><a name="16"><h2>16. Positions of asteroids</h2>

For asteroids, the orbital elements are often given as: N,i,w,a,e,M,
where N,i,w are valid for a specific epoch (nowadays usually 2000.0).
In our simplified computational scheme, the only significant changes
with the epoch occurs in N.  To convert N_Epoch to the N (today's
epoch) we want to use, simply add a correction for precession:<br>

<pre>    N = N_Epoch + 0.013967 * ( 2000.0 - Epoch ) + 3.82394E-5 * d
</pre>

where Epoch is expressed as a year with fractions, e.g. 1950.0 or 2000.0<br><br>

Most often M, the mean anomaly, is given for another day than the day
we want to compute the asteroid's position for.  If the daily motion,
n, is given, simply add n * (time difference in days) to M.  If n is
not given, but the period P (in days) is given, then n = 360.0/P.  If
P is not given, it can be computed from:<br>

<pre>    P = 365.2568984 * a**1.5 (days) = 1.00004024 * a**1.5   <i>(years)</i>
</pre>

** is the power-of operator.  a**1.5 is the same as sqrt(a*a*a).<br><br>

When all orbital elements has been computed, proceed as with the
other planets (</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#6">section 6</a>).<br><br>


<a name="17"><h2>17. Position of comets.</h2>

For comets having elliptical orbits, M is usually not given. Instead
T, the time of perihelion, is given.  At perihelion M is zero.  To
compute M for any other moment, first compute the "day number" d of T
(</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#3">section 3</a>), let's call this dT.  Then compute the
"day number" d of the moment for which you want to compute a
position, let's call this d.  Then M, the mean anomaly, is computed
like:<br>

<pre>    M = 360.0 * (d-dT)/P    (degrees)
</pre>

where P is given in days, and d-dT of course is the time since last
perihelion, also in days.<br><br>

Also, a, the semi-major axis, is usually not given.  Instead q, the
perihelion distance, is given.  a can easily be computed from q and
e:<br>

<pre>    a = q / (1.0 - e)
</pre>

Then proceed as with an asteroid (<a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#16">section 16</a>).<br><br>


<a name="18"><h2>18. Parabolic orbits</h2>

If the comet has a parabolic orbit, a different method has to be
used.  Then the orbital period of the comet is infinite, and M (the
mean anomaly) is always zero.  The eccentricity, e, is always exactly
1.  Since the semi-major axis, a, is infinite, we must instead
directly use the perihelion distance, q.  To compute a parabolic
orbit, we proceed like this:<br><br>

Compute the "day number", d, for T, the moment of perihelion, call
this dT.  Compute d for the moment we want to compute a position,
call it d (</a><a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#3">section 3</a>).  The constant k is the Gaussian
gravitational constant: <i>k = 0.01720209895 exactly!</i><br><br>

Then compute:<br>

<pre>    H = (d-dT) * (k/sqrt(2)) / q**1.5
</pre>

where  q**1.5 is the same as sqrt(q*q*q).  Also compute:<br>

<pre>    h = 1.5 * H
    g = sqrt( 1.0 + h*h )
    s = cbrt( g + h ) - cbrt( g - h )
</pre>

cbrt() is the cube root function: cbrt(x) = x**(1.0/3.0).  The
formulae has been devised so that both g+h and g-h always are
positive.  Therefore one can here safely compute cbrt(x) as
exp(log(x)/3.0) .  In general, cbrt(-x) = -cbrt(x) and of course
cbrt(0) = 0.<br><br>

Instead of trying to compute some eccentric anomaly, we compute the
true anomaly and the heliocentric distance directly:<br>

<pre>    v = 2.0 * atan(s)
    r = q * ( 1.0 + s*s )
</pre>

When we know the true anomaly and the heliocentric distance, we can
proceed by computing the position in space (<a href="http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#7">section 7</a>).<br><br>


<a name="19"><h2>19. Near-parabolic orbits.</h2>
 
The most common case for a newly discovered comet is that the orbit
isn't an exact parabola, but very nearly so.  It's eccentricity is
slightly below, or slightly above, one.  The algorithm presented here
can be used for eccentricities between about 0.98 and 1.02.  If the
eccentricity is smaller than 0.98 the elliptic algorithm (Kepler's
equation/etc) should be used instead.  No known comet has an
eccentricity exceeding 1.02.<br><br>

As for the purely parabolic orbit, we start by computing the time
since perihelion in days, d-dT, and the perihelion distance, q.  We
also need to know the eccentricity, e.  The constant k is the
Gaussian gravitational constant: <i>k = 0.01720209895 exactly!</i>
<br><br>

Then we can proceed as:<br>

<pre>    a = 0.75 * (d-dT) * k * sqrt( (1 + e) / (q*q*q) )
    b = sqrt( 1 + a*a )
    W = cbrt(b + a) - cbrt(b - a)
    f = (1 - e) / (1 + e)

    a1 = (2/3) + (2/5) * W*W
    a2 = (7/5) + (33/35) * W*W + (37/175) * W**4
    a3 = W*W * ( (432/175) + (956/1125) * W*W + (84/1575) * W**4 )

    C = W*W / (1 + W*W)
    g = f * C*C
    w = W * ( 1 + f * C * ( a1 + a2*g + a3*g*g ) )

    v = 2 * atan(w)
    r = q * ( 1 + w*w ) / ( 1 + w*w * f )
</pre>

This algorithm yields the true anomaly, v, and the heliocentric
distance, r, for a nearly-parabolic orbit.  Note that this algorithm
will fail very far from the perihelion; however the accuracy is
sufficient for all comets closer than Pluto.<br><br>

<a name="21"><h2>21. Validity of orbital elements.</h2>

Due to perturbations from mainly the giant planets, like Jupiter and
Saturn, the orbital elements of celestial bodies are constantly
changing.  The orbital elements for the Sun, Moon and the major
planets, as given here, are valid for a long time period.  However,
orbital elemets given for a comet or an asteroid are valid only for a
limited time.  How long they are valid is hard to say generally. It
depends on many factors, such as the accuracy you need, and the
magnitude of the perturbations the comet or asteroid is subjected to
from, say, Jupiter.  A comet might travel in roughly the same orbit
several orbital periods, experiencing only slight perturbations, but
suddenly it might pass very close to Jupiter and get its orbit
changed drastically.  To compute this in a reliable way is quite
complicated and completely out of scope for this description.  As a
rule of thumb, though, one can assume that an asteriod, if one uses
the orbital elements for a specific epoch, one or a few revolutions
away from that moment will have an error in its computed position of
at least one or a few arc minutes, and possibly more.  The errors
will accumulate with time.<br><br>
